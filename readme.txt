The easiest way to make your Gravity Forms GDPR-compliant. Fully documented, extendable and developer-friendly.

== Description ==

The easiest way to make your Gravity Forms GDPR-compliant GDPR compliant!

This plugin adds new privacy features to Gravity Forms. Your visitors can download or delete their form submissions automatically or submit a request for the site admin to do so.

Until WordPress releases their own GDPR compliance update, this plugin requires [The GDPR Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gdpr-framework/) to function (it's free!)

Make sure to also read the guide! You don't need to drown your customers in pointless acceptance checkboxes if you know what you're doing!
